# About this Everyday Carry site
<img class="about" alt="Keven" src="/images/me.jpg" width="250" />

This site shows the three things I always take with me: my phone, my AirPods, and my keys.  
I need to stay in touch with my family, I need to be able to study without distractions, and I need to be able to get into my car and house.

- **Phone** for school, directions, and talking with family.
- **AirPods** for taking calls fast and zoning out.
- **Keys** so I can lock and unlock home and car.
